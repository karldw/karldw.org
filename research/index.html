<h3><a href="https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/WP329.pdf">Rate of Return Regulation Revisited</a></h3>
<p><b>Coauthor:</b> <a href="https://stephenjarvis.github.io/">Stephen Jarvis</a></p>
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>

Utility companies recover their capital costs through regulator-approved rates
of return. Using a comprehensive database of utility rate cases, we find a
significant premium for regulated returns on equity relative to several capital
cost benchmarks. We show that firms decide strategically when to initiate
new rate cases, such that regulated returns respond more quickly to increases
in underlying capital cost benchmarks than to decreases. Higher regulated
returns incentivize utilities to own more capital: a one percentage point rise
in return on equity increases capital assets by 3&ndash;4%. Overall we find excess
costs to US consumers averaging $7&nbsp;billion per year.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Oil and gas wells emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Emissions are minimally
regulated, leading to a large climate externality. We explore how technologies can
enhance welfare gains from regulatory policies by providing policymakers with more
information. We focus on audit policies with realistic constraints, such as limited audit
budgets and caps on fees. We develop a model of emission abatement, estimate the
abatement costs using cross-sectional data from scientific studies, and simulate
welfare gains from policies with varying levels of information availability. We show
targeting substantially improves the effectiveness of policies. In particular, a policy that
audits 1&nbsp;percent of wells with uniform probability achieves 0.3% of the gains of the
infeasible first best, while targeting audits using remotely sensed emissions can
achieve 16% of the first best, even with moderate fee levels.
